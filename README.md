# MNIST Digit Classification using PyTorch

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify MNIST handwritten digits with 99% accuracy using PyTorch.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture
The model uses a modern CNN architecture with the following key features:
- Two convolutional blocks with batch normalization & DropOut
- Global Average Pooling (GAP)
- Dropout for regularization
- ~16K trainable parameters
