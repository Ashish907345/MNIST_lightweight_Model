# MNIST Digit Classification using PyTorch

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify MNIST handwritten digits with 99% accuracy using PyTorch.

## 🎯 Project Overview
The model uses a modern CNN architecture with the following key features:
- Two convolutional blocks with batch normalization
- Global Average Pooling (GAP)
- Dropout for regularization
- ~40K trainable parameters
